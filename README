zorbage-gdal: code for using the GDAL data file loading library to populate data into zorbage structures for further processing

To learn more about Zorbage please visit https://github.com/bdezonia/zorbage

To learn more about Gdal please visit https://gdal.org/

Code examples:

  Must do this at the beginning of your program:
  
    Gdal.init();
  
  Now to open all data associated with a data file:
    
    DataBundle results = Gdal.open("sunset.jpg");

Prerequisites (only Ubuntu instructions below)

  Install gdal and support files:

  < do this for ubuntu 18 LTS, not needed for ubuntu 20.04 LTS >
  
  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntugis/ppa
  sudo apt-get update
  
  < then do this for Ubuntu 18 and Ubuntu 20 >
  
  sudo apt-get install gdal-bin
  sudo apt-get install libgdal-dev
  sudo apt-get install libgdal-java
  
  Note: you can also install newer versions of GDAL as binaries
  directly from https://gdal.org/download.html if the repo install
  directions above do not give you a new enough release for your needs.
  
  On Ubuntu 22 you may have trouble installing gdal via apt.
  I have tested that you can build gdal from source and
  skip the apt-get install gdal-bin command above and things
  will work fine. I had to specify CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX as
  /usr and GDAL_JAVA_INSTALL_DIR as /usr/java/packages/lib
  
  If you go this route then:
    Find gdal source here:
      https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/DownloadSource
    Find build instructions here:
